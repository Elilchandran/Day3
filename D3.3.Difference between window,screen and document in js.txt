3.1. Introduction:
   
3.1.1.Windows:
            The window object is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy. It represents the browser window or tab, and it contains all other objects related to the browser window, including the document object.

3.1.2.Documents:
            The document object is also top-level object and it is property of the window object. It represents the web page loaded in the browser window. It provides access to the HTML elements and other resources of the web page.while window is the top-level object that contains document, document is the top-level object for interacting with the content of the web page itself.

3.1.3.Screen:
           The screen object provides information about the physical screen or monitor. 


3.2. Difference between Window, Screen and Document in JavaScript with Code:

3.2.1.Windows:
       The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the top-level object that contains all other objects related to the browser window. You can access the window object using the global variable window. 
               For example:// Get the current window object
                            const currentWindow = window;


3.2.2.Documents:
          The document object represents the web page loaded in the browser window. It provides access to the HTML elements and other resources of the web page. You can access the document object using the window.document property. 
               For example: // Get the title of the current web page
                               const pageTitle = window.document.title;

                           // Get an HTML element by its ID
                              const elementById = window.document.getElementById('myElement');

                          // Get all the paragraphs on the page
                             const allParagraphs = window.document.getElementsByTagName('p');


3.2.3.Screen:
    The screen object represents the physical screen or monitor of the device on which the browser is running. It provides information about the size and resolution of the screen. You can access the screen object using the window.screen property. 
               For example:// Get the screen width and height
                              const screenWidth = window.screen.width;
                              const screenHeight = window.screen.height;


These objects are related to each other, but they serve different purposes. The window object is the top-level object that contains all other objects related to the browser window, including the screen and document objects. The screen object provides information about the physical screen or monitor, while the document object provides access to the web page loaded in the browser window.
